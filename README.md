# IJmacro_StarchGranuleSegmentationWithStardist

This is an ImageJ macro that allows to segment starch granules with a Stardist model specifically trained to this purpose (StarchGranuleSegmentation_Stardist_model.zip) and measure their Feret's diameter. You need to install the CSBDeep and StarDist plugins in Fiji to make the macro work.
